Thank you Jaafar for your insightful and balanced post. You've successfully captured the central ethical dilemma Abi faces and 
grounded it within robust professional frameworks. Your emphasis on integrity, transparency, and the potential social impact 
of statistical misrepresentation is particularly important in the context of public health.

I fully agree with your citation of the American Statistical Association (2022) and the British Computer Society (2018)—both 
of which stress that partial or biased reporting violates professional responsibilities and can mislead decision-makers. S
elective reporting, even with accurate data, is a form of deception by omission. It not only threatens public trust but also 
conflicts with the principle of non-maleficence central to ethics in both computing and health research (Gillon, 1994).

I also appreciate your point about regulatory compliance, especially the mention of the EU General Food Law Regulation 
(EC No. 178/2002). This adds a crucial legal dimension to Abi’s dilemma. If the manufacturer markets the cereal based on 
misleadingly positive interpretations, Abi could be complicit—even if unintentionally—in violating consumer protection laws.

Your reference to O’Neill (2016) rightly highlights the broader societal consequences. Public confidence in science is fragile, and researchers like Abi bear the responsibility of reinforcing, not undermining, that trust.
In summary, your analysis rightly places Abi’s ethical obligation not just within the scope of what is legal or expected, 
but within a wider framework of moral accountability that places public welfare first. Well done.
