Thank you, Jaafar, for your clear and thoughtful post. The ethical issues around Abi’s situation are complex, and you 
presented them in a balanced and well-informed way. I also appreciated the professional sources you used to support your 
analysis.

Many of the important points were already raised in Marwa’s response, including the risks of selective reporting and the 
need to protect public trust. I agree with those points and would like to add a few additional perspectives.
It might be valuable to examine the role of organisational culture and ethical leadership in supporting professionals like 
Abi. According to Kaptein (2011), a strong ethical culture within organisations reduces the likelihood of unethical 
behaviour and encourages individuals to act in line with moral standards. In situations where commercial pressures are 
present, such an environment can help professionals remain guided by ethical principles.
You could also consider addressing the option of whistleblowing, particularly if internal reporting does not lead to 
responsible action. Whistleblowing refers to the act of exposing unethical or harmful practices within an organisation, 
either internally or externally. According to Mesmer-Magnus and Viswesvaran (2005), whistleblowing behaviour is shaped by 
both individual and organisational factors, and can be influenced by the likelihood of retaliation and the perceived 
effectiveness of reporting mechanisms. In Abi’s case, if the manufacturer misuses the report and internal avenues are 
ineffective, reporting the issue to an external regulatory body may be an ethically justifiable course of action to 
protect public health.

Finally, the idea of moral courage is also important. As Lachman (2007) explains, professionals sometimes face difficult 
decisions where doing the right thing involves personal or professional risk. Recognising this can help us understand how 
hard these situations are, and why support from professional organisations is so necessary.

I hope these reflections offer useful additions to your thoughtful discussion of the ethical challenges in Abi’s case.
