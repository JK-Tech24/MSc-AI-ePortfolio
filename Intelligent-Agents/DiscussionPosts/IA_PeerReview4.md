Your post highlights real risks in authorship, bias, and misuse. I agree with the core of your arguments. I add two ideas: separate model skills from rule-setting power. Assess uses by evidence of reduced harm, not just intentions.

For copyright and ownership, data sources form the main issue. Lacking solid records of data origins and consent methods, claims to original work remain weak. Dataset inventories and source-tracking standards allow large-scale checks of origins and rights (Gebru et al., 2018; C2PA, 2023). Such transparency supports fair agreements and targeted deletions.

The bias concerns you note are valid. Bias stems from training data and tool applications. Connect risks to the specific job. An art tool encounters different threats than a hiring tool. A straightforward approach—identify risks, test them, refine—grounds discussions in actual outcomes (Bender et al., 2021; NIST, 2023).

On misuse, open-ended outputs create spam, deepfakes, and targeted falsehoods. Layered protections work well: traceable content, bans on harmful actions, and post-use reviews (Weidinger et al., 2022; Kirchenbauer et al., 2023).

Practical actions: • Insist on data logs, approved sources, and deletion options before training or updates. • Mandate pre-release audits, with tests for bias, safety, and misuse linked to job-specific threats. • Embed safeguards early: usage caps, blocks on dangerous queries, and activity logs. • Apply source labels (C2PA) and technical watermarks to support attribution and compliance. • Commit to external audits and share repeatable test summaries.

These steps do not erase all dangers. They clarify accountability—and enable responses.
