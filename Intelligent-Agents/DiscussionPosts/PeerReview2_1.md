The focus on KQML is particularly appropriate because of its conversational depth. By using performatives such as inform, request, or propose, agents can communicate data, intentions, and commitments within distributed multi-agent systems (Finin, Labrou and Mayfield, 1997).

This highlights how KQML enables richer and more expressive interactions than straightforward method invocation.

However, semantic interoperability is one of the primary issues. Lack of interoperable or standardised ontologies might lead to misinterpretations, even though agents may exchange KQML messages without technical problems. Sycara (1998) asserts that this challenge emphasises how important ontology construction is to enabling effective agent communication. These issues are being addressed by semantic web technologies and linked data standards developments, which could make KQML-style communication more practical.

A clear trade-off also exists between performance and flexibility. Method invocation in Python or Java is fast, simple, and well-suited to tightly coupled systems. In contrast, open and heterogeneous settings that require asynchronous interaction, negotiation, and discovery are ideal for agent communication languages (Jennings, Sycara, and Wooldridge, 1998). In such cases, the flexibility gained justifies the additional overhead of parsing and ontology management.

Hybrid solutions have been suggested between efficiency and expressiveness. For example, a more expressive ACL such as KQML may be utilised to govern high-level negotiation and coordination, while lightweight method invocation could govern routine contact (Wooldridge, 2009). Such hybrid approaches preserve efficiency while still supporting semantically rich communication.

The decision to use KQML or direct method invocation ultimately depends on the deployment context. Distributed, autonomous, and negotiation-intensive environments benefit from the expressiveness of agent communication languages, whereas simpler, tightly coupled systems function more effectively with direct method calls.
