Your post gave a clear and concise explanation of how ACLs like KQML work and why they’re so valuable in distributed systems. I especially appreciated your point about ACLs supporting negotiation and reasoning—it really shows their strength in more dynamic and diverse environments. That said, as you pointed out, complexity and ambiguity are still major hurdles.

One way to address this early on could have been the adoption of standardized ontology management. If multi-agent systems had agreed on a common set of ontologies from the beginning, agents wouldn’t have to “guess” each other’s meanings. That would significantly cut down on interpretation errors (Labrou and Finin, 1997). Pairing this with ontology mapping and alignment tools would have helped too, by automatically resolving differences between agent vocabularies (Gruber, 2008).

When it comes to performance, ACLs might have benefited from a layered communication model. For example, lightweight, simplified messages could be used for routine exchanges, while more complex and semantically rich messages would be reserved for situations where deeper understanding is needed (Jennings and Bussmann, 2003). This kind of hybrid setup would maintain the flexibility of ACLs while avoiding performance bottlenecks.

Overall, your post does a great job of showing that ACLs are powerful tools, though not without cost. But with early steps like stronger ontology standards, automated alignment, and layered communication models, many of the challenges you mentioned could have been avoided.
