I liked how you explained that ACLs are about more than just passing data—they let agents communicate intent, which is crucial in open and distributed systems. Your example of supply chains and e-commerce really brought that to life, since those environments often involve independent agents that need to work together without being built on the same platform.

Still, as you pointed out, ACLs come with a lot of complexity. One way to prevent this could have been the use of lightweight semantic frameworks. By creating a smaller core set of performatives for everyday communication and keeping the more complex ones optional, systems could reduce processing overhead (Labrou, Finin and Peng, 1999). Ontology alignment tools could also help by resolving misunderstandings when agents interpret messages differently (Euzenat and Shvaiko, 2013). These tools allow agents to share meaning more easily without relying on manual fixes.

You also mentioned how developers often prefer simple method calls over using ACLs. A way to address that would be to better integrate ACLs into the programming environments developers are already comfortable with (Da Silva et al., 2019). If ACL libraries were as accessible and well-supported as typical API calls, it’s likely they would have seen broader adoption.

All in all, your post does a great job of showing how ACLs move AI forward by allowing systems to understand and act on intent. With preventive steps like streamlined messaging, support for ontologies, and better developer tools, many of the challenges you mentioned might have been reduced
