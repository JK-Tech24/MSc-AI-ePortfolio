Hi Murthy,

You brought up some important challenges with ACLs, especially the difficulty in building and maintaining shared ontologies. That’s a big issue—if different agents use different vocabularies, they can easily misunderstand each other’s intentions. That kind of miscommunication can lead to serious coordination problems.

One way to help prevent this is by pushing for stronger standardization of core ontologies across different systems. When developers can agree on a common baseline, agents are less likely to misinterpret each other and more likely to work together effectively (Labrou, Finin and Peng, 1999). Another helpful solution is to use automated ontology alignment tools. These tools reduce the need for manual adjustments by helping agents translate between different vocabularies (Russell and Norvig, 2020).

You also mentioned the overhead and verbosity in KQML. To prevent slowdowns, one strategy could be adopting hybrid communication models. That means using lightweight messages for simple tasks and saving the richer ACL structures for more complex conversations (Singh, 2013). This kind of layered approach keeps communication efficient without losing semantic detail.

In short, while ACLs offer more flexibility and depth than basic method calls, approaches like shared standards, semi-automated ontology alignment, and hybrid protocols could have helped avoid many of the issues you mentioned.
