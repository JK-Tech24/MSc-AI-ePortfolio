When looking at agent communication languages (ACLs) such as KQML, the main issue is finding a balance between rich interaction and efficiency. Unlike simple method calls in languages like Python or Java, KQML enables agents to have structured conversations using performatives like inform, request, or propose (Finin, Labrou & Mayfield, 1997). This depth of conversation allows agents to negotiate, coordinate, or show uncertainty, which is much more than what a direct function call can offer. 

The benefits are clear: rich semantics, platform independence, and support for asynchronous communication. Agents built in different environments can interact smoothly while continuing their work without waiting for replies (Labrou & Finin, 1997). These features are crucial in open, distributed, and dynamic systems where autonomy and flexibility are essential (Drasko & Rakic, 2024). 

However, these strengths have trade-offs. As my peer Murthy pointed out, semantic interoperability is a persistent issue. Two agents might send messages but not truly “understand” each other without shared ontologies (Sycara, 1998). Performance costs are also significant—parsing structured messages and managing ontologies uses far more resources than a simple method call (Wooldridge, 2009). 

This is why hybrid approaches appeal to many. Using KQML for negotiation and coordination, while relying on direct method calls for routine interactions, helps maintain efficiency without sacrificing expressiveness (Jennings, Sycara & Wooldridge, 1998). Ultimately, the decision depends on the context: tightly coupled systems benefit from method calls, while diverse, negotiation-focused environments require the conversational flexibility of ACLs. 

In summary, KQML shows the conflict between expressiveness and performance. Ongoing advances in semantic web technologies indicate that many of today’s interoperability challenges may improve in the future, making agent communication languages more practical for real-world use (Smythos, 2025).
