The rise of Deep Learning tools like DALL·E for creating images and ChatGPT for generating text is truly captivating, but it also brings up some important questions that we can't ignore. One major concern is about authorship and ownership. If AI is trained on millions of creative works that artists never consented to use, can we really call the end result “original”? It feels like we’re standing in a grey zone of copyright and intellectual property (ScienceTimes, 2025).

Bias is another significant issue. These systems learn from the data they’re given, and that data often includes stereotypes. For example, OpenAI’s “Sora” video model has been found to produce sexist, racist, and ableist content without any explicit instructions (Wired, 2025). This means that rather than challenging bias, the technology risks normalising it.

Then there’s the more troubling aspect: misuse. Generative AI can be exploited for spreading misinformation, creating deepfakes, or even producing harmful content. Disturbingly, there are already instances of AI being used to generate child sexual abuse material (AP News, 2024). This isn’t just a theoretical concern—it’s happening right now.

Some people argue that with the right regulations, these tools could enhance creativity and make knowledge more accessible. I agree to an extent, but right now the ethical risks seem to surpass the potential benefits. To move forward in a responsible way, we need transparency, regulation, and a genuine dialogue about what’s acceptable.
