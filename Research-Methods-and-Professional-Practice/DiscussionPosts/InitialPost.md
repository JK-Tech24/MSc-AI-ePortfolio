Case Study: Malware Disruption – An Ethical Review

The case of Rogue Services, an ISP that supports malicious actors under the guise of guaranteed uptime, presents a complex ethical dilemma. According to the ACM Code of Ethics, Rogue clearly violated several foundational principles. By knowingly enabling malware distribution and spam through their infrastructure, Rogue breached Principle 1.1 and 1.2 (ACM, 2018). By ignoring repeated warnings demonstrates a disregard for the harmful impact their services were causing.

Principle 2.8, which mandates access to other people’s computing systems and data, was also breached, as Rogue's systems hosted unauthorized and harmful software (ACM, 2018). In addition to that, the British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct supports this view through Section 1b related to public interest, and Section 2d, which calls for the avoidance of actions that could harm others or bring the profession into disrepute (BCS, 2015).

The counteraction deployment of a targeted worm poses its own ethical challenges. While unauthorized, it aligns with ACM Principle 1.2 in mitigating greater harm, and was designed with self-limiting mechanisms to avoid broader collateral damage (Moor, 2005; Tavani, 2016). However, the BCS Code (Section 2c) highlights the obligation to avoid causing unwarranted harm to third parties, which did happen when innocent retailers lost their data (BCS, 2015).

Jurisdictionally, Rogue exploited the gaps in national laws to avoid regulation, showing a global problem in cyberlaw harmonization (Spinello, 2013). Socially, although the fallout was temporarily effective, it raises questions about digital vigilantism, data ownership, and proportional response (Floridi, 2013). This case shows the tension between ethical imperatives and legal constraints, stressing the need for enhanced global standards and greater professionalism among computing practitioners.
