The Rogue Services case illustrates how ethical concerns in the cyber world persist even when legal and technical measures 
exist. The initial analysis showed how Rogue deliberately supported malicious actions and violated key principles under 
the ACM and BCS codes—namely ACM 1.1, 1.2, and 2.8, and BCS sections 1b, 2c, and 2d (ACM, 2018; BCS, 2015). 
Additionally, the case underscores the ethical complexities of the release of malware which caused unintended consequences to 
innocent third parties.

Dhia's comment refers to the unpredictability of cybersecurity actions. Despite precautions to follow such ethical guidelines 
as ACM 1.2 to avoid harm, the real-world consequences can impact other things, such as BCS 2c. This highlights the ethical 
risk of pushing good intentions too far without sufficiently taking ripple effects into account (BCS, 2015; ACM, 2018).

Martyna followed up on this debate by highlighting the accountability challenge in distributed systems. Her citation of 
Johnson and Miller (2008) comes in with the idea that responsibility is hard to trace due to the presence of several actors 
and jurisdictions. This is relevant in the case of Rogue, where the firm took advantage of jurisdictional gaps to avoid 
accountability.

Craig brought to the discussion an essential legal and moral view. He said that by ignoring repeated alerts, Rogue Services not only exposes consumers to possible cyberattacks but also shows a great disrespect for integrity and responsibility. Additionally, Craig brings up a crucial point about hosting that probably violates data security laws and therefore stressing failure morally and legally.
In conclusion, the conduct of Rogue Services shows a major breach of legal norms as well as professional ethics. The actions 
of the firm provide a warning example of how ignoring the ACM Code of Ethics might jeopardize consumers, damage public trust,
and put businesses at legal risk.
