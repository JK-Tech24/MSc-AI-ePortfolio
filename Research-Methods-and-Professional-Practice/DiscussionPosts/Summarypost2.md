Abi's ethical challenges in presenting statistical information highlight the basic principles of integrity, transparency, 
and professional accountability in data analysis (American Statistical Association [ASA], 2022). Following ethical standards 
from the ASA (2022) and the British Computer Society (BCS, 2018), my initial post underlined Abi's responsibility to give 
an accurate, balanced representation of all results—regardless of their favorability. Moreover, I emphasized the legal 
ramifications related to the European Union's General Food Law Regulation (EC No. 178/2002) which mandates truthful food 
labeling to safeguard consumers (European Parliament and Council, 2002).

The peer responses stressed the importance of keeping ethical standards in research with a broader look at ethical ideas 
in organizations. Marwa pointed out that even sharing certain data only is a form of dishonesty and goes against important 
ethical principles. She also mentioned that if misleading data is presented, it can lead to legal issues (Gillon, 1994), 
which adds another layer to Abi’s responsibilities.

Martyna highlighted how organizational culture and ethical leadership can empower professionals like Abi to maintain ethical 
standards under corporate demands despite commercial pressures (Kaptein, 2011). She also brought up the need of 
whistleblowing as a protective mechanism; however, when internal reporting does not work, she highlightied the ethical 
rationale for external reporting to protect public health (Mesmer-Magnus and Viswesvaran, 2005). Martyna's last reflection 
on moral courage acknowledges the personal and professional hazards connected with ethical decision-making and the need for 
professional organizations to offer essential support (Lachman, 2007).

Together, these ideas deepen knowledge of Abi's moral conflict beyond technical reporting, placing it within a complex interaction of legal obligations, professional ethics, organizational environment, and individual moral agency. As such, Abi's duty includes not only transparency and accurate reporting but also active participation in creating an ethical culture and, when necessary, taking bold steps to protect public interest.
