The situation of ABI highlights an essential ethical challenge in statistical work: ensuring integrity, transparency and 
responsibility in data analysis. Although the temptation to only present the favorable results, researchers should avoid 
any manipulation or selective reporting that can mislead stakeholders (ASA, 2022).

Abi has an ethical obligation to provide a true and fair depiction (ASA, 2022) and report all relevant results, whether positive
or negative. The British Computer Society (BCS, 2018) reiterates this idea and insist that computing professionals act 
truthfully and avoid conduct that could undermine public confidence. Although ABI cannot fully control how the manufacturer 
uses the report, it should reduce the risks (ASA, 2022). Should the data show any potential loss, ABI must consider warning 
regulatory bodies, align with legal frameworks such as the European Union General Food Law Regulation (EC No. 178/2002) that 
mandates the accurate food labeling for the protection of consumers (European Parliament and Council, 2002).

At the social level, misleading nutritional data can destroy public confidence in science and harm weak consumers (O'Neill, 2016). Commercially, ABI's credibility and career depends on maintaining moral standards set by organizations such as The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE, 2020), which asks for responsible and transparent research practices.
In conclusion, Abi’s duty is clear: to act with transparency and balance and prioritize public interest over convenience or commercial interests.
