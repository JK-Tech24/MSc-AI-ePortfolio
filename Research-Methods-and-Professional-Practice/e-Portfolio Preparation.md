Reflect on one module that has impacted or will impact my professional practice:

If I had to choose a module which has fundamentally changed how I engage with problem solving - it was Unit 3 - Modules related to methodology and research methods covered many different research methodologies and focused on how ontological and epistemological beliefs and assumptions influenced research questions and research methods. 
 
In my work and practice

- I intend to design for upcoming user experience research .
