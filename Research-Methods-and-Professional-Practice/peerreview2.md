Dear Jaafar,
Your post offers a strong explanation of the ethical issues in the Rogue Services case. You clearly showed how the company’s actions go against the ACM and BCS 
codes of conduct, especially with references to principles like ACM 1.1, 1.2, and 2.8 (ACM, 2018; BCS, 2015). This shows a solid understanding of the frameworks 
we have been working with.

I found your discussion of the worm particularly interesting. You explained well how, even though it was meant to prevent harm, it ended up affecting innocent third 
parties. That highlights the ethical tension between good intentions and harmful consequences, and you clearly considered both sides (Moor, 2005; Tavani, 2016).

One area you could explore further is accountability in global or distributed systems. In this case, Rogue was able to operate by taking advantage of legal gaps 
across jurisdictions. This raises important questions about who is responsible when harm happens in these complex setups. Johnson and Miller (2008) point out that 
responsibility can become unclear in digital networks with many actors involved. Looking at this angle might add more depth to the ethical analysis, especially 
where legal systems struggle to respond effectively.
