â€œWell written post thank you for sharing. You clearly articulate how Rogue services violate the ACM code of conduct. Rogue Services' actions clearly violate key 
principles of professional computing ethics. The code emphasises prioritising the public good and preventing harm (ACM, 2018), yet by allowing malware to be hosted,
the company directly endangers users through potential ransomware and cyberattacks. It also fails to uphold integrity and professional responsibility by ignoring 
repeated requests to take action. Furthermore, hosting malicious software likely breaches cybersecurity laws, showing a disregard for legal obligations. These 
failures collectively demonstrate a serious ethical and legal lapse.
